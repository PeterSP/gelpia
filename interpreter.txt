An instruction sequnce is defined as
inst_seq : inst
         | inst "," inst_seq

An <inst> is as follows:

Push onto stack:
"c#": pushes a constant to the stack, # is an integer index 
      into the constants array.
"i#": pushes a variabe to the stack, # is an integer index into 
      the variables array.
"v#": pushes a user created variable to the stack, # is an integer index into
      the user variables array.

Operators:
"o<op>":  applies the operator <op>, where <op> is in {+, -, *, /, p},
       where p is interval exponent power function.

Functions:
"f<name>":  Applies single arg function <name> to the top of the 
	    stack, where <name> is in {abs, sin, cos, tan,
	    exp, log, neg}.

Integer power function:
"p#": Applies the power function to the top of the stack with integer exponent
      #.
