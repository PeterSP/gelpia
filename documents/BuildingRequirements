If the automatic requirements script does not work for your particular
system submit a bug to the git, until that is resolved use this as a
guide for installing requirements by hand.


Rust:
	A nightly build must be used, which can be found at:
	  https://www.rust-lang.org/downloads.html
	Under the nightly section.

	untar and cd to the source directory
	run `./configure --prefix=<where you want rust>`
	run `make && make install`

	Make sure you have the location of the install in your PATH
	and set it in your shell's configuration file



crlibm:
	The most recent version of crlibm can be found at:
	    http://lipforge.ens-lyon.fr/projects/crlibm

	untar and cd to the source directory
	run `export CFLAGS=-fPIC $CFLAGS`
	run `export LDFLAGS=-fPIC $LDFLAGS`
	run `./configure --enable-sse2 --prefix=<where you want crlibm>`
	run `make && make install`

	Make sure you have the location of the install in your LIBRARY_PATH
	and set it in your shell's configuration file



Gaol:
	For gaol to work you must first have crlibm.
	The most recent version of gaol can be found at:
	    http://sourceforge.net/projects/gaol/

	untar and cd to the source directory
	run `./configure  --with-mathlib=crlibm --enable-simd --disable-debug --disable-preserve-rounding --enable-optmize --disable-verbose-mode --prefix=<where you want gaol>`
	run `make && make install`

	Make sure you have the location of the install in your LIBRARY_PATH,
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH, CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH, and CPATH
	and set it in your shell's configuration file
