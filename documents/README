Global Extrema Locator Parallelization for Interval Arithmetic

Currently known to build on Ubuntu 14.04

Requires:
rust 1.0
gaol (4.2.0)

For automatic building of requirements run /requirements/build.sh
For building by hand see documents/BuildingRequirements


If the automatic build script is used only the PATH variable needs to be
modified, the others get modified during gelpia execution. If the requirements
are installed by hand all environment variables must be modified as indicated in
documents/BuildingRequirements.


Once requirements are met gelpia may be made by running make in the git's root
directory. This runs rust's cargo build system as well as it adds the correct
files to bin for execution.


Gelpia may then be ran, it is an executable in the bin directory.
