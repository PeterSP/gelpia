Global Extrema Locator Parallelization for Interval Arithmetic

Currently known to build on Ubuntu 14.04

Requires:
rust 1.0
gaol (4.2.0)

For automatic building of requirements run /requirements/build.sh
For building by hand see documents/BuildingRequirements


Once requirements are met gelpia may be made by running make in the git's root
directory. This runs rust's cargo build system as well as it adds the correct
files to bin for execution.


Gelpia may then be ran, it is an executable in the bin directory.
It has a built in help system for argument clarification.
A file may be specified which has arguments in it, one per line, this name
must be preceded by an @ symbol. The examples directory has many of these
files. Additional arguments, or overwiting arguments, may be specified after the
file.

example uses:
